When you need to authenticate on a website, you typically want to use the same <ApiLink to="class/Session">`Session`</ApiLink> throughout the crawl. This requires additional configuration of the <ApiLink to="class/SessionPool">`SessionPool`</ApiLink>. Learn more in the [session management guide](../guides/session-management).

## Login with Playwright crawler

This example shows how to log in to a website using the <ApiLink to="class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink>.

<RunnableCodeBlock className="language-python" language="python">
    {PlaywrightLogin}
</RunnableCodeBlock>

## Login with HTTP crawler

This example demonstrates how to log in using the <ApiLink to="class/HttpCrawler">`HttpCrawler`</ApiLink> by sending a POST <ApiLink to="class/Request">`Request`</ApiLink> with credentials to an API endpoint. HTTP-based authentication typically requires a more customized approach for each website, using [DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview) and analyzing the `network` tab to understand the authentication flow.
