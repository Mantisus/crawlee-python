Sometimes to extract data from a website, you need to log in to access the target pages. This guide demonstrates how to do this using <ApiLink to="class/PlaywrightCrawler">PlaywrightCrawler</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to="class/HttpCrawler">HttpCrawler</ApiLink>.

When you need to authenticate on a website, you typically want to use the same <ApiLink to="class/Session">Session</ApiLink> throughout the crawl. This requires additional configuration of the <ApiLink to="class/SessionPool">SessionPool</ApiLink>. Learn more in the [session management guide](./session-management). If you need to use multiple <ApiLink to="class/Session">Sessions</ApiLink> with different credentials, use the `new_session_function` parameter for <ApiLink to="class/SessionPool#__init__">SessionPool</ApiLink> and the `session_id` parameter for <ApiLink to="class/Request#from_url">Request</ApiLink> to bind requests to specific sessions.

For this guide, we'll use a demo site specifically created for automation testing that provides various interactive elements including a [login form](https://demoqa.com/login).

## Login with Playwright crawler

This example shows how to log in to a website using the <ApiLink to="class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink>.

<RunnableCodeBlock className="language-python" language="python">
    {PlaywrightLogin}
</RunnableCodeBlock>

## Login with HTTP crawler

This example demonstrates how to log in using the <ApiLink to="class/HttpCrawler">`HttpCrawler`</ApiLink> by sending a POST <ApiLink to="class/Request">`Request`</ApiLink> with credentials to an API endpoint. HTTP-based authentication typically requires a more customized approach for each website, using [DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview) and analyzing the `network` tab to understand the authentication flow.

<RunnableCodeBlock className="language-python" language="python">
    {HttpLogin}
</RunnableCodeBlock>
