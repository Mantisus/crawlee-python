<ApiLink to="class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink> is a powerful web crawler built on top of the `Playwright` browser automation library. It provides a robust foundation for automated web interactions, particularly when dealing with modern, dynamic websites.

## When to use PlaywrightCrawler

<ApiLink to="class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink> is designed for complex scenarios requiring browser functionality:

* **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Handles websites that rely on client-side JavaScript for content generation and dynamic rendering

* **Anti-Scraping Protection**: Works with websites implementing advanced protection mechanisms and JavaScript-based security measures

* **Complex Cookie Management**: Supports sites with client-side cookie generation logic and session management requirements

This makes <ApiLink to="class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink> an essential tool when implementation using http-based crawler is not feasible.

The following [example](../examples/playwright-crawler) demonstrates the basic usage of <ApiLink to="class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink>

## Advanced usage

You can flexibly configure <ApiLink to="class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink> using <ApiLink to="class/BrowserPool">`BrowserPool`</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to="class/PlaywrightBrowserPlugin">`PlaywrightBrowserPlugin`</ApiLink>.

<ApiLink to="class/PlaywrightBrowserPlugin">`PlaywrightBrowserPlugin`</ApiLink> manages settings for browser instance launches. It allows you to pass both [launch](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch) and [context](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context) configuration options.

<ApiLink to="class/BrowserPool">`BrowserPool`</ApiLink> manages browser lifecycles.

## Launching Multiple Browsers

You might need to launch multiple browser instances for different scenarios, such as testing various approaches or implementing browser rotation during crawling.

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {MultipleLaunchExample}
</CodeBlock>

## Configuring browser and context

<ApiLink to="class/PlaywrightBrowserPlugin">`PlaywrightBrowserPlugin`</ApiLink> supports all configuration options available in Playwright for both [browser launch](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch) and [context creation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context).

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {BrowserConfiguration}
</CodeBlock>

Similarly, you can configure each plugin in <ApiLink to="class/BrowserPool">`BrowserPool`</ApiLink>

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {PluginBrowserConfiguration}
</CodeBlock>

## Configuring page using pre_navigation_hook

In some cases, you may need to apply specific settings to the page before the crawler navigates to the target URL, such as setting a navigation timeout.

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {PreNavigation}
</CodeBlock>
